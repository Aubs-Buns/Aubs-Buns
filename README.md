- I have a lot of names, you can call me Rye, Shy, Aubs, Aubrey, Bun, or Alejandro. Literally pick and choose I love all of them!
   - I'm a huge coder, I love writing, and I'm a okay artist!
      - I do say some offensive things AT TIMES, But I never really mean them. I'm not used to using tone tags and stuff so it's kinda hard to know when I'm joking, but
